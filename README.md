### About this Blueprint

This Blueprint increases or decreases product quantity for a specific subscription via CloudBlue REST-API. I only works if you have one product per subscription! If you have multiple products in the same subscription, only the first will be updated.

> Note: The provisioning of licenses is async and you are not allowed to update a subscription that is currently in provisioning mode.

## Deploy

1. Open the BPMN diagram in Camunda Modeler.
2. Deploy the BPMN diagram (click `Deploy current diagram` and follow the steps).

## Run

This workflow should be run as a _adhoc workflow_ and can be part of another process.
Here is an example how to get a secret using a simple `curl` command.

### Variables

* `subscriptionId` - The id for the subscription
* `poNumber` - Purchase order number (optional)
* `changeType` - `increase` or `decrease` the quantity 
* `units` - Units to either increase or decrease product quantity

### Example request 

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  '{url}/api/v2/my/workflows/run/cloudblue-commerce-change-subscription?timeout=180' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: {auth-token}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
 "subscriptionId": 123456,
 "poNumber": "9999",
 "changeType": "increase",
 "units" : 1
}'
```

> Note: It can take more than 60 seconds for the order request, so make sure you increase default timeout.
